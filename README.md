# Book Class Project

This project is a Python program that creates a Book class. The Book class includes the basic details about a book like the title, author, price, and ISBN. The class also has some methods that allow you to display this information and check if the book is expensive.

## Files in the Project

- main.py: This file contains the Python code for the Book class. It defines the attributes like title, author, price, and ISBN and has methods to display the information and check if the book is expensive.
- uml_diagram.png: A picture of a UML diagram that shows the structure of the Book class, including its attributes and methods.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository to your computer by running this command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nazikka/Book-Class-Project.git
2.Open the project in your IDE (for example, PyCharm).

3.Run the main.py file to see how the Book class works. You can change the details of the books or add more books and test the methods.

Future Plans for the Project
Add more details about books like genre and publication year.
Add more methods, for example, to compare books based on their price.
Make the program interactive so users can enter book details more easily.
